Sniper Monkey is a tower in the Bloons TD series that made its debut in Bloons TD 5. Its first ever appearance was in the Bloons TD 5 trailer that was released on November 29, 2011. It was the first tower to pop multiple layers of bloon per shot, dealing multiple damage per shot. The Sniper Monkey has infinite range, but its vision can be blocked by obstacles.

Here are some of math formulas:
\\~\\
Difference of n-th powers: \( a^n - b^n =(a-b)(\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a^{n-1-k}b^{k})\)
\\~\\
\[ \int e^x \,dx = e^x+C\]
